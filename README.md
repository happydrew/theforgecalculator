## 🛠️ How Forging Works in The Forge

### Ore Requirements & Combinations

To begin forging, you need at least 3 ores, with a maximum of 4 different ore types. The quantity of ores you use determines which weapon or armor classes become available. For weapons, you can forge with 3-51 ores, while armor requires 3-37 ores. Using a **[forge calculator](https://theforgecalculator.info)** helps you understand exactly which equipment types are possible with your current ore selection.

### Multipliers Explained

Each ore type has a multiplier value that affects your weapon or armor's base stats. Important to note: multipliers don't stack—the game uses the average multiplier from all ores you add. Top multipliers include:

- **Arcane Crystal Ore**: 7.5x
- **Darkryte**: 6.3x
- **Demonite**: 5.5x
- **Rainbow Crystal Ore**: 5.25x
- **Magmaite**: 5.0x

Our **the forge roblox calculator** automatically calculates your average multiplier, helping you optimize ore combinations for maximum power.

### Trait Activation System

Special ore traits activate when an ore type represents at least 10% of your total ore combination. Trait effectiveness increases at higher percentages:

- **10%** - Minimum effectiveness
- **20%** - Good effectiveness
- **30%** - Optimal effectiveness

The **[forge roblox calculator](https://theforgecalculator.info)** displays active traits and their effectiveness levels, ensuring you get the most powerful bonuses possible.

### Weapon & Armor Classes

Different ore counts unlock specific equipment classes:

- **Lower counts (3-10 ores)**: Favor lighter equipment like daggers and light armor
- **Medium counts (15-30 ores)**: Balanced equipment like swords and medium armor
- **Higher counts (30-51 ores)**: Heavy weapons like greataxes and heavy armor sets

Using a **calculator the forge** tool shows you the exact probability for each class based on your ore selection.

## 💡 Advanced Forging Tips

### Balancing Quality and Quantity

While using high-multiplier ores is tempting, remember that **the forge roblox calculator** calculates averages. Mixing one 7.5x ore with three 1x ores gives you an average of just 2.625x. For better results, try to keep your ore multipliers within a similar range.

### Trait Stacking Strategy

To maximize trait bonuses, use the **[forge roblox calculator](https://theforgecalculator.info)** to ensure your key ore types reach the 30% threshold. For example, if you want Lightite's weapon damage bonus, make sure Lightite represents at least 30% of your total ore count for optimal effectiveness.

### Planning for Specific Weapons

If you're targeting a specific weapon or armor class, use our **calculator the forge** to find the sweet spot. For example:

- **Greataxes**: Highest probability around 45-51 ores
- **Swords**: Best chances with 20-35 ores
- **Daggers**: Most common with 3-6 ores

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### How accurate is the forge calculator?

Our **[forge calculator](https://theforgecalculator.info)** uses probability tables extracted directly from The Forge Roblox game data, making it highly accurate for predicting weapon and armor class chances. However, the actual stats of your forged equipment also depend on your performance in the forging mini-games.

### What's the difference between weapon and armor forging?

Weapons can use 3-51 ores and include classes like daggers, swords, axes, and bows. Armor requires 3-37 ores and comes in three types (helmet, chestplate, leggings) with light, medium, and heavy variants. **The forge roblox calculator** handles both modes with separate probability calculations.

### Can I use more than 4 ore types?

No, The Forge limits you to 4 different ore types per forging session, but you can use any quantity of each type (within the mode's ore count limits). Use the **[calculator the forge](https://theforgecalculator.info)** tool to experiment with different combinations within this constraint.

### How do I get the best traits?

For optimal trait activation, ensure your target ore type represents at least 30% of your total ore count. Our **forge roblox calculator** shows trait activation status and effectiveness percentages, helping you achieve the "Optimal" tier for maximum bonuses.

### Does the calculator work for mobile?

Yes! Our **[the forge calculator](https://theforgecalculator.info)** is fully responsive and works perfectly on mobile devices, tablets, and desktop computers. You can plan your forges on any device before heading into the game.

### Why does your calculator show different stats for each variant?

Because variant stats **actually differ** in the game! For example, Dragon Slayer has 24 base damage with 1.4s attack time, while Colossal Sword has 20 base damage with 1.12s attack time—resulting in different DPS values. Other calculators ignore these differences and only show generic estimates, but our **[forge roblox calculator](https://theforgecalculator.info)** displays accurate individual stats for every variant, making it the most precise tool available. This helps you understand the full range of possible outcomes when you forge.
